        "# **Machine Learning (Learning for Scenario Anticipation)**\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence focused on developing systems capable of learning from data and experience without explicit programming. It includes Supervised Learning, which utilizes labeled data; Unsupervised Learning, which analyzes unlabeled data; and Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns from interactions. Essential processes in ML are Predictive Analytics, employing algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, and Data-Driven Classification for categorizing items. Feature Engineering improves model effectiveness through data refinement. Python is the dominant programming language for ML, with support from platforms like Google Colab and libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn. The ML workflow encompasses data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation through accuracy metrics."
